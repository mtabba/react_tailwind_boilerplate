### How to use this boilerplate? :blue_heart:

Clone the repo or download this. Go to the directory and run command:
`npm install`

This will install all the necessary dependencies.
Now you can start building your react app. No need to import any css files.

Starting point for the project is: `index.js`

### Importing tailwind.generated.css :rocket:

You only need to add this once in index.js:
`import "./tailwind.generated.css";`
As it has already been added for you in index.js and is accesible to all components you don't need to do anything.

## Available Scripts :penguin:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` :watch:

Runs the app in the development mode and watches for changes in tailwind classes.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` :hammer:

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Tailwind css generated is minified.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
